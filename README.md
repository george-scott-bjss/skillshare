# Skillshare / Skllshr

Skillshr is a web application that allows users to create accounts and list skills that they would like to teach and learn. The app was conceived, designed and developed from start to finish by a small working group. The back end uses Google Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database, and the front end has been built with React. The TalkJS library is used for instant messaging functionality, and postcode and geocoding APIs are used to sort search results geographically.  

## Using the app

To run skillshare, please ensure you have NodeJS installed.

Clone the repository to a local directory. navigate to the /skillshare directory and run the 'npm i' command in a terminal to install all dependencies for the project.

Then, in the same directory, run the 'npm start' to run the React app on a local port.

The app has been optimised for viewing on an iPhone X resolution, which can be emulated through many browser developer tools.
